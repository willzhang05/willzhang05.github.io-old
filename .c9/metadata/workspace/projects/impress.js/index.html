We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,\n        do we?\n        \n        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file.

This class means, that browser doesn't\n    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.\n    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not\n    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript\n    will also get fallback styles.\n    \n    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will\n    be removed.\n    \n    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about\n    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.\n    \n-->\n<body class=\"impress-not-supported\">\n\n<!--\n    For example this fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.\n-->\n<div class=\"fallback-message\">\n    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>\n    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>\n</div>\n\n<!--\n    \n    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.\n    \n    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.\n    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.\n    \n    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.\n    \n    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration=\"2000\"` giving it\n    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).\n    \n    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective=\"500\"` giving it a number of pixels.\n    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.\n    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:\n    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective\n    \n    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesting things\n    right around the corner of this tag ;)\n    \n-->\n<div id=\"impress\">\n\n    <!--\n        \n        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.\n        \n        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name\n        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and\n        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.\n        \n        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.\n        \n        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x=\"-1000\"`\n        and `data-y=\"-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)\n        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.\n        \n        It will not be rotated or scaled.\n        \n    -->\n    <!--<div id=\"bored\" class=\"step slide\" data-x=\"-1000\" data-y=\"-1500\">\n        <q>Aren't you just <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>\n    </div>\n\n\n        \n        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.\n        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.\n        \n        So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.\n        \n        The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.\n        \n        You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.\n        \n        Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.\n        Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.\n        \n    -->\n    <!--\n    <div class=\"step slide\" data-x=\"0\"

</div>\n\n        \n        This is an example of step element being scaled.\n        \n        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale=\"4\"`, so it means that this\n        element will be 4 times larger than the others.\n        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled\n        down (4 times) to make it back to its correct

animated.\n        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is\n        reached.\n        \n        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.\n        It means that they haven't been visited yet.\n        \n        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.\n        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.\n        \n        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`\n        class is added.\n        \n        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.\n        Only one current step has the `present`

It may not be\n    so clear because of all these \"ids\" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with\n    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.\n    \n    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when\n    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.\n    \n    ...\n    \n    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)\n    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.\n    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be\n    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.\n    \n    Just sayin' ;)\n    \n-->\n<div class=\"hint\">\n    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>\n</div>\n<script>\nif (\"ontouchstart\" in document.documentElement) { \n    document.querySelector(\".hint\").innerHTML = \"<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>\";\n}\n</script>\n\n<!--\n    \n    Last, but not least.\n    \n    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.\n    I strongly encourage to minify it first.\n    \n    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.\n    \n    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.\n    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also\n    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.\n    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of \"DOM ready\" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)\n    \n-->\n<script src=\"js/impress.js\"></script>\n<script>impress().init();</script>\n\n<!--\n    \n    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.\n    \n    Just store the result of the call:\n    \n        var api = impress();\n    \n    and you will get three functions you can call:\n    \n        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,\n        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,\n        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,\n        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number\n                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,\n                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.\n    \n    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.\n    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.\n    \n    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API\n    is used in event handlers.\n    \n-->\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n<!--\n    \n    Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before\n    you start...\n    \n    Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?\n    \n    You have it open in text editor?\n    \n    Stop right there!\n    \n    That's not how you create awesome presentations.
